### Pitch A Tent (working title)

Project utilizes Google Maps Javascript API in a React environment.

## Tech:

- React
- Firebase Auth
- Firebase DB
- Module CSS
- National Parks Services API

## Goals:

Authenticated maps service that allows users to save campsites and their descriptions and view campsites from other users. To inspire users, the map comes preloaded with all National Parks Services' campgrounds (at least all that is listed on their api). This list of preloaded campgrounds does not include state or private sites.

Inspired to organize and structure the codebase for maintainability. I tried to separate all the components, libraries, and utilities. This is also why I chose CSS Modules.
